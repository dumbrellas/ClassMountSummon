### Summon your Legion class mount easily with ```/cmount```

- Will warn you if your class does not have class mounts (Evoker)
- Will warn if you if you don't have any class mounts unlocked
- Will warn you if your class mount is tied to flight form (Druid)
- For classes with multiple mounts (Rogue, Paladin, Hunter), it will summon a randomly known class mount
